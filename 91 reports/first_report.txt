1. Objective and Abstract
2. Why do we need this project(Scope)

1 . Preliminary papers and MAin paper : 
s  : i Images worth 16 x 16 words
                ii Analysis Paper (Neuron embedding visualisation)
               (tk) iii 03 Visualizing_and_Understanding_Patch_Interactions_in_Vision_Transformer


2. Code Used: Kentaroy (also tell about architecthture in some detail) and parameters etc etc 
and train time, epochs etc etc
3 Dataset : i) Dataset 1: Oxford pet (5k images too less to train transformer) Even tried reducing classes
                from 30 to 2 still didnt achieve high accuracy
            ii) Cifar-10 : 
                    a) Learning Rate: 1e-3  , 150 epoches and 77% accuracy
                 
                    b) Learning Rate: 5e-3  , 90 epoches and 86% accuracy

                    c) Heads: 2  , 90 epoches and 84% accuracy
                    d)  Heads: 8  , 90 epoches and 86% accuracy

4. training results : time take, accuracy etc etc

5.. Analysis : 
i. Saved checkpoints(weights only) every 10 epoches
ii. Got correctly classified images (5)
iii Passed image through model and saved attention
iv Plotted attention heat map 
v. (tk) Tested on different dataset(Results):
