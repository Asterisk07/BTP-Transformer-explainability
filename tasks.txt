downscale model while maintaing performance

1. change image to black and white [x3] ayushmaan âœ…
2.  per class 100 images , reduce to 20 [x5] yajat : see operations on type (torchvision.datasets.oxford_iiit_pet.OxfordIIITPet)
3. downscale image pixels from 144 to 72 yajat
3. paramaters:
    n_heads : 
    n_embed or emb_dim : decrease from 32
    patchsize : increase from 4
    n_layer decrease from 6

4. Run reduced code, expected <1hr
