Choosing the ViT :

1. according to wikipedia History section(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_transformer#History), and this citation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_transformer#cite_note-:3-1), this is the paper that introduced Vision transformer for the first time(https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11929)

2. so we should use this paper, and search for a good github code, preferably supported by a youtube video as well.

RESOUCE LIST:
    a) Daniel lebourke:
            + Have seen this guys vids before for DL , he is legit good
            + video Explanation : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjpW_BY8y3g
            + pdf explanation : https://www.learnpytorch.io/08_pytorch_paper_replicating/
            + code : https://github.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning/blob/main/08_pytorch_paper_replicating.ipynb

    b) some redditor :
            + dont know who this is 
            + reddit post : https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/11nj58o/p_implementing_vision_transformer_vit_from/
            + code : in above
            + medium post : in above 

things to do : 
☐ go through above two resources 
☐ see which one is good 
☐ look for additional resources and add them to the list above 
☐ finally select one
