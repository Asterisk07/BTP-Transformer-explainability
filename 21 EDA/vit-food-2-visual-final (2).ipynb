Using a pretrained ViT from `torchvision.models` on the same dataset\n","\n","We've discussed the benefits of using pretrained models in [06. PyTorch Transfer Learning](https://www.learnpytorch.io/06_pytorch_transfer_learning/).\n","\n","But since we've now trained our own ViT from scratch and achieved less than optimal results, the benefits of transfer learning (using a pretrained model) really shine.\n","\n","### 10.1 Why use a pretrained model?\n","\n","An important note on many modern machine learning research papers is that much of the results are obtained with large datasets and vast compute resources.\n","\n","And in modern day machine learning, the original fully trained ViT would likely not be considered a \"super large\" training setup (models are continually getting bigger and bigger).\n","\n","Reading the ViT paper section 4.2:\n","\n","> Finally, the ViT-L/16 model pre-trained on the public ImageNet-21k dataset performs well on most datasets too, while taking fewer resources to pre-train: it could be trained using a standard cloud TPUv3 with 8 cores in approximately **30 days**.\n","\n","As of July 2022, the [price for renting a TPUv3](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/pricing) (Tensor Processing Unit version 3) with 8 cores on Google Cloud is $8 USD per hour.\n","\n","To rent one for 30 straight days would cost **$5,760 USD**.\n","\n","This cost (monetary and time) may be viable for some larger research teams or enterprises but for many people it's not.\n","\n","So having a pretrained model available through resources like [`torchvision.models`](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/models.html), the [`timm` (Torch Image Models) library](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models), the [HuggingFace Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) or even from the authors of the papers themselves (there's a growing trend for machine learning researchers to release the code and pretrained models from their research papers, I'm a big fan of this trend, many of these resources can be found on [Paperswithcode.com](https://paperswithcode.com/)).\n","\n","If you're focused on leveraging the benefits of a specific model architecture rather than creating your custom architecture, I'd highly recommend using a pretrained
